## Display Features

### Status Bar

Displays system health:

```text
BME✓ LUX✓ SOIL✓ BAT✓ WF✓ IO✓
```

### Environmental Data

* Temperature (°F)
* Temperature (°C)
* Lux
* Soil Moisture
* Battery Status

### Marquee

Scrolling system status messages.

## React Dashboard

The `frontend/` app mirrors the onboard TFT dashboard. A Go backend reads the
Adafruit IO feeds so the browser does not receive the Adafruit IO key.

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env
set -a
. ./.env
set +a
go run .
```

In another terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` to the Go backend on port `8080`. For a
production-style local run, build the frontend first and start the backend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ../backend
set -a
. ./.env
set +a
go run .
```

The dashboard polls Adafruit IO every 30 seconds and uses the latest feed timestamps for the status indicators.
The backend caches feed responses for 30 seconds by default. Override with
`FEED_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` if needed.

### Docker Deployment

Build the deployable image:

```bash
docker build -t home-garden-dashboard .
```

Run it locally without exposing secrets in the frontend:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  --env-file backend/.env \
  home-garden-dashboard
```

For Render, Fly.io, or another host, deploy this Dockerfile as a single web
service and set these runtime environment variables in the provider's secret or
environment settings:

```text
ADAFRUIT_IO_USERNAME
ADAFRUIT_IO_KEY
FEED_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=30
```

Do not set the Adafruit IO key as a Docker build argument or any `VITE_*`
frontend variable.

### Render Deployment

Public dashboard:

```text
https://home-garden-cpb2.onrender.com/
```

Deploy this repo as a Docker web service. If Render detects it as a native Go
service, the backend may start without a built `frontend/dist` and `/` will
return `404`.

Use the included `render.yaml` Blueprint or configure the service manually:

* Runtime: Docker
* Dockerfile path: `./Dockerfile`
* Runtime environment variables:
  * `ADAFRUIT_IO_USERNAME`
  * `ADAFRUIT_IO_KEY`
  * `FEED_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=30`

After changing the service type or Dockerfile, trigger a manual deploy with
Clear build cache.

## Adafruit IO Feeds

Current feeds:

```text
temperature
humidity
pressure
gas
lux
soil-raw
soil-voltage
soil-percent
battery-voltage
battery-percent
```

Adafruit IO feed keys use dashes for multi-word names. Local C++ and React
state identifiers may use underscores, but API endpoints and `io.feed(...)`
names should use the dash-separated feed keys above.

Planned:

```text
system-voltage
system-current
system-power
```

## Secrets Management

Credentials are stored in:

```cpp
secrets.h
```

Example:

```cpp
#pragma once

#define WIFI_SSID "your-wifi"
#define WIFI_PASS "your-password"

#define IO_USERNAME "your-username"
#define IO_KEY "your-adafruit-io-key"
```

Do not commit this file.

Add to `.gitignore`:

```text
secrets.h
```

## Required Libraries

Install via Arduino Library Manager:

* Adafruit BME680 Library
* Adafruit VEML7700 Library
* Adafruit MAX1704X Library
* Adafruit IO Arduino
* Adafruit GFX Library
* Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library

## Build Environment

* Arduino IDE 2.x
* ESP32 Board Package 3.x
* Fedora Linux

## Power

Current:

```text
USB or LiPo battery
Timer-based deep sleep
WiFi disabled between telemetry uploads
TFT and supported sensors placed in sleep mode
```

Deep sleep is configured in `config.h`:

```cpp
#define DEEP_SLEEP_MODE true

const uint64_t DEEP_SLEEP_INTERVAL_US =
  5ULL * 60ULL * 1000000ULL;
```

Each wake reads the sensors, connects to Adafruit IO, uploads one sample,
disables WiFi, and returns to deep sleep.

The VH400 must be powered through a switched supply or suitable GPIO/load
switch to eliminate its current draw during deep sleep. Connecting it directly
to 3.3 V leaves it powered while the ESP32 sleeps.

INA260 Power Monitoring
Solar Charging
```
